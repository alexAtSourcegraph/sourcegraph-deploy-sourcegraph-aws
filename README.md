# Deploy Sourcegraph on AWS using Terraform

Deploying Sourcegraph on AWS now takes less than 5 minutes and a couple of commands.

## Prerequisites

- Make (installed if you're macOS and Linux)
- [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) (optional but required for self-signed cert validation)

> NOTE: A basic level of knowledge and experience using [AWS IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/index.html#lang/en_us) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) is required.

## Terraform plans

- [EC2](ec2/README.md)

More will be added in the future.
